# ðŸ’µ Server operation costs
Nimble's server runs on a dedicated machine with an i7-7700K CPU and 64 GB of DDR4 memory. This hardware is not cheap. However, we are currently not accepting donations at this time.

In the future, we may opt to create a Patreon page for donations as we do not want to offer in-game rewards for supporting us. Supporting our server should always be purely optional.

Since Nimble is a new server with a small playerbase, we are currently not in need of external support to maintain ourselves.
