# ðŸ”Ž Transparency
There are many Minecraft servers that claim a "vanilla" experience but end up tweaking the game's mechanics or installing plugins that modify the game in unexpected ways. It's also hard to know what changes a server has made as server software is almost always closed-source.

To bring peace of mind to our players, Nimble open-sources not only the software we are using, but also our whole server directory, including every configuration file. You can view our [server files here](https://github.com/nmblmc/server).

We hope to have complete transparency about our server and ensure that our playerbase knows everything that goes on behind the scenes. We aren't trying to pull a clever trick on anyone; what you see is how it is.
