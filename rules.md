# ðŸ“— Server rules
One of Nimble's main goals is to not enforce arbitrary limitations on our server or the gameplay experience.

That being said, we would still like to ensure we have a pleasant experience on the server, so any rules we do enforce will be backed up by logic and reasoning.

Our current rules are as follows:
1. **No illegal activity**: Any illegal activity is strongly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban from the server. We do not want to be responsible for hosting any illegal activity on our server and want to protect our players from real, potential threats. Nimble is not complete anarchy and we will take action if we notice activity of this kind.
2. **No server-degrading activity**: Intentionally hurting server performance or playability will result in a permanent ban. We would like to keep our server online at all times for everyone who would like to play. Creating intentional lag on the server, such as building a "lag machine," is strongly prohibited as it causes the server to become unplayable to most players.

If you have a question about the rules, please feel free to open an issue on this repository.
